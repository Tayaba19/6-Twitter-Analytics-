Learn to Build a Real-Time Twitter Analytics Dashboard with Power BI
Introduction
In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become powerful tools for businesses, organizations, and individuals to connect with their audience. Real-time analysis of Twitter data can provide valuable insights into public sentiment, brand reputation, and market trends. This project aims to guide you through the process of building a real-time Twitter analytics dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
Background
Twitter is a microblogging platform that allows users to share short text messages, images, and videos. The platform generates a massive amount of data in real-time, making it a valuable source of information. Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool that enables users to visualize and analyze data. By combining Twitter's real-time data with Power BI's visualization capabilities, we can create a powerful tool for gaining insights from social media.
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you will be able to:
•	Understand the basics of Twitter API and how to extract real-time data.
•	Clean and prepare Twitter data for analysis.
•	Create a robust data model in Power BI.
•	Design and develop interactive visualizations to present insights.
•	Deploy the dashboard to Power BI Service or embed it in a website.
•	Analyze real-time Twitter trends.
•	Identify opportunities for improvement and optimization.
Activities and Tasks
1. Create a visual that shows the average engagement rate and total impressions for tweets posted between '01- 01-2020' and '30-06-2020'. Filter out tweets that received fewer than 100 impressions and like should be 0 and this graph should work only between 3Pm to 5 PM IST apart from that we should not show the graph.

2. Build a chart to identify the top 10 tweets by the sum of retweets and likes. Filter out tweets posted on weekends and show the user profile that posted each tweet and this graph should work between 3 PM to 6 PM and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be below 30

3. Analyse tweets to show a comparison of the engagement rate for tweets with app opens versus tweets without app opens. Include only tweets posted between 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays and this graph should work between 12 PM to 6 PM and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be below 40.
